            <p>I am a diligent, pro-active and reflective individual who is passionate about web development.
                Currently, I am proficient with HTML and I am excited to learn all about CSS next.
                I have built 3 HTML projects so far: Movie Ranking Project, Birthday Invite Project and a HTML portfolio.
                You can also view my HTML portfolio in my GitHub. I hope to showcase more of my projects in the future, and when I have further upskilled myself, I intend on contributing to open source.
                Alongside learning web development, I a full-time teacher who has had middle leadership roles in 'oustanding' schools and been the lead of teams with upto 6 people.
                This demonstrates, that I also have well developed soft skills required for working in teams, but that I am also capable of being proactive and managing my own time.
                I have taught in international private schools in the Middle East,which has allowed me to work with people from various different backgrounds and cultures.
                Overall, I love creating websites and helping drive people towards the websites I have created.</p>
            <p>I look forward to working with you</p>
